            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Structure: </strong>The structure is basically octagonal. It is capped at its centre by a dome.The octagonal arcade and the inner circular drum create an inner ambulatorium that encircles the holy rock.Both the circular drum
                    and the exterior walls contain many windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Interior Design: </strong>The interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Exterior decoration: </strong>The decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls. 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleyman the Magnificent
                    replaced it with Turkish faience tiles. The Ottoman tile decoration was replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy.</li>
